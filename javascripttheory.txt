why javascript is an interpreter.?
ans:-as compiler will not allow to run any code if an error is encountered.
but interpreter runs the code line by line ,if any error is encountered so the code above the error will run.

javascript is based on prototype
convert asynchronous to synchronous ,,technologies used.

executional/global context:- static .variables which are defined previously

functional/local context:- dynamic context of function.

event

call stack:984 kb  :interpretation : when function is called the context of function is putted inside call stack .and is executed.then removed
                    from the call stack;

browser make a stack in which context is defined. also known as compilation.
then call stack is made to run/execute;


javascript-single threaded -single process executed,slows down it is single threaded because it has only one global/execution context.'

there is only one call stack for a global context

asynchronous task is done and taken away from normal execution and is independent.

primitive data type:- by defaults : number, boolean, undefined, null, string,symbol(symbol is defined in new version of javascript)

typeof(null)

non-primitve: array(heterogenous items can be putted inside array),object(associative array:- element accessed by key values instead of index)
object->
 var a={
    z:10,
    c="avx",
    x:50;

}
for accessing
ob.a;
ob["a";]
